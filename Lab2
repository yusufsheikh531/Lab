/* 
1. Create a Bank class and declare an instance variable named amount of type double.Create parameterized constructor to initialize variable "amount" 
with value 10000.Create two methods withdraw(double withdrawalAmount) and deposit(double depositAmount).Calculate withdrawal based on some condition 
(using ternary operator) like If amount is sufficient then "withdraw successful" message will be printed on the console and amount should be updated 
after withdraw. Later on, deposit 5000 in the account balance.At the end display total balance on the console. String message = (withdrawal Amount <= amount) ? 
"Withdrawal successful" : "Insufficient balance";
