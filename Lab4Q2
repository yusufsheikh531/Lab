//Lab D4 ques_no. 2

/*
2.	Write a Java program that demonstrates method overriding by creating a superclass called Animal and two subclasses called Dog and Cat.
	* The Animal class should have a method called makeSound(), which simply prints "The animal makes a sound."
	* The Dog and Cat classes should override this method to print "TheCat/The dog meows/barks" respectively.
	* The program should allow the user to create and display objects of each class.						[Hint:Use multilevel inheritance]
*/

class Animal {
	public void makeSound() {
	System.out.println("\tThe animal makes a sound. ");
	}
}

class Dog extends Animal{
	@Override
		public void makeSound(){
		System.out.println("\t The dog barks. ");
		}
}

class Cat extends Animal{
	@Override 
		public void makeSound() {
		System.out.println("\t The cat meows.");
		}
}

public class AnimalSound {
	public static void main(String[] args){
	Animal animal = new Animal();		//creating obj for each class
	Dog dog = new Dog();
	Cat cat = new Cat();
	
	System.out.print("\tAnimal sound :");
	animal.makeSound();

	System.out.print("\t Dog sound :");
	dog.makeSound();

	System.out.print("\t Cat sound : ");
